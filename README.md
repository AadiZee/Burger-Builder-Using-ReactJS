v1.0: A burger builder website that display a burger on the main screen which updates as the user adds more ingredients. Currently there is only The main page and the order summary page. The code is mobile friendly. I will be adding Http requests as we move forward and i will also make the website look more beautiful in the coming versions.

V2.0: Alot of work has been done. There is now authentication that is required to place an order and in case you want to view your previous orders. There is an order form with form validity. All the data is store in firebase (URL for FIREBASE has been REMOVED from this upload). I have also used REACT REDUX for state management but then i replaced it with REACT HOOKS. There are also tests that i used to test my code as well. REACT ROUTING is also present for navigation. I might have missed some stuff but there are a lot of changes as compared to V1.0. The CSS for the burger is also available seperately on my GITHUB.
